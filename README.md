# Game Boy Amenizer ROM Sample Replacer

A small Python Flask web app that takes a `.raw` audio sample, applies a 4-bit conversion, and injects it into the first 16 KB of an existing Game Boy ROM (`amenizer.gb`). The result is a new `.gb` file ready to flash to your Game Boy for custom audio samples.
